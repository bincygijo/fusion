some good ideas: http://mjr.towers.org.uk/blog/2004-7.html#webcal0929

 - add support for real users - started

 - ability to display the next N events or events within a certain range.

 - enhancements to display:
     if id and next are set, show ids start with id and going on for $next
     if year is given, show that year
     
 - make recurring events more powerful:
     this is the big one. times events happen should have their own table
     eventID, day, week, month, year, time of day
     all of the fields of the occurance must be true, and all occurances are
     OR'd. so an event can occur multiple time in one day.

 - display range of time in month view rather than just start time (maybe?)

 - add version to database (so we know when to update it)

 - Change event entry to use radio dialogs and have specific information in
   each (see http://www.calendarscript.com/)

 - add label support (events should be able to have multiple labels that will
     affect their presentation). label table:
       calendar,
       eventID,
       class (for style),
       color (should multiple labels have their colors blended?),
       title (primary key)

 - perhaps switch to some kind of class for the calendar so it can be
   easily embedded within other websites.

 - make sure we don't display elements of the page a user does not have
   access to. (ie. modify/delete links for anonymous users)

 - add groups a la unix. allow users to specify which group an event will
   belong to. allow only users with write access to a group to add/edit/delete
   events in that group. same kind of thing for read access.

 - retain day/month/year info for the present view when clicking on an event

 - add comments for events

 - view events by labels and date ranges.

 - open add event links in a javascript window.
 
 - have some kind of approval queue for incoming messages
 
 - add rel="nofollow" to links posted by anonymous users (or some scheme
   to decide who, maybe everyone)

 - make users, admin stuff

 - confirmation on delete

 - allow passwords to be changed

later:
 - integrate email_events.php (where is this?)
 - abstract things out better to allow for theming, etc. maybe.
 - add a full year view. days with events should be a different color.
   full day events should be another color. (maybe use labels for this?)
