So far only versions 0.8 and later are supported.

Previous versions of 0.10 and 0.9. You should be able to just copy your
config.php into the new directory (or just simply overwrite the old directory).
You may need to install or update ADOdb. Please see the INSTALL file for more
information.

Either copy your config file over or use the update.php to specify the location.
Open update.php in your web browser. It should automatically update your old
database. I highly recommend backing up your database before doing this. I am
not responsible for any damage done. Copy the text to your config.php (you
should overwrite an text that was in there previously).

You're done.
