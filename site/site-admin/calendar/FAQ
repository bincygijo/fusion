Q: How do I fit the calendar into the theme of my website?
A: Currently this is an arduous task. You need to edit includes/calendar.php
   You want to edit the function create_xhtml(). Make it something like:

function create_xhtml($rest)
{
        global $config, $phpc_script;

        // if your header has a doctype, skip this line. Hopefully you're
	// using xhtml, if not, you can edit includes/html.php to produce html
        $output = "<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0//EN\"\n"
                ."\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\n";
	// if your header is static
        $output .= file_get_contents("/your/site/location/header.html");
	// if it's dynamic, it's trickier, you could skip the above line
	// and simply include it here, or you could use outputbuffers and try
	// it that way

	// Make sure that your header can include the styelsheet for
	// php-calendar, or copy the style from our stylesheet into yours
        // the tag is: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
	//   href="$phpc_script?action=style">

	// you might not need the following, or you might need it earlier
	$output .= "<body><h1>${config['calendar_title']}</h1>";
	
	// the following should be in, but you can skip the linkbar
	$navbar = navbar();
	$linkbar = link_bar();
        $output .= $navbar->toString()
                .$rest->toString()
                .$linkbar->toString();

	// this might be necessary
	$output .= "</body></html>";

        return $output;
}

   I don't make any guarantees on that bit of code, but hopefully it will help
   you get started in the right direction.

Q: How do I allow HTML in the descriptions of events?
A: Read and follow comments in the function parse_desc() in
   includes/calendar.php

Q: How do I get the links for translations to appear?
A: You need to build the .mo files for the languages you want. To do this, go
   into the directory for each language you want (ex. locale/de/LC_MESSAGES)
   and run: msgfmt messages.po
   I have no experience with this in Windows. Read the manual for gettext for
   more information.
