        <li>A Message from the Year Coordinator</li>
        <li>Student Editorial</li>

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Yearbook Tip:</strong><br />
      To make your article more engaging try and write in the style of a magazine or newspaper instead of a formal report.</p>
      <p>Add extra sensory dimensions to your story (though remember it&rsquo;s your yearbook so think positive):</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>The <b>sound </b>of the crowd cheering&hellip;</li>
        <li>The <b>smell</b> of the muffins being baked in the cooking rooms wafted throughout the school</li>
        <li>The sun beamed down on us and kept us warm throughout the day</li>
        <li>Our cheer squd</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Add your own positive emotions and experience to the story:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>I can say I felt very proud</li>
        <li>The atmosphere was electric</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Getting an insight into the moment from a few students can help to grab the reader&rsquo;s attention. Add in some quotes from stand-out performers, spectators or staff:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Mr Jones said <span class="quotes">&ldquo;</span>I am very proud of all of our students. They put in a great effort in the pool and our cheer-squad out-cheered all other schools!<span class="quotes">&rdquo;</span></li>
      </ul>
