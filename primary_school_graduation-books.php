        <li>Student Profiles- to help capture the students&rsquo; personalities </li>
        <li>Snapshots from around the school</li>
        <li>Photos from each of their classes, for example sport class, art and English.</li>
        <li>Photos from recess and lunchtime</li>
        <li>Photos from dress-up days and sports carnivals</li>
        <li>Students art-work that has been scanned</li>
        <li>Scan in a hand-written piece</li>
        <li>Students poetry and short stories</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Students also enjoying autographing and writing farewell messages on their classmates yearbooks.</p>
