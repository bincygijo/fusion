      <h1>How to <span>Snap like a Pro</span></h1>
      <p><strong>Here are 8 easy steps to help you snap like a pro:</strong></p>
	  <div align="center"><img src="images/volleyball.jpg" alt="Capture the action" title="Capture the action" /></div>
	  <div class="highlight">
	    <h1>Your Equipment</h1>
	    <div class="photo"><img src="images/equipment.jpg" alt="Your Equipment" /></div>
	    <div class="details">Ensure you have a high-quality camera and use a tripod. <br />
        A high-quality camera</div>
      </div>
	   <div class="highlight">
	    <h1><strong>Use natural light</strong></h1>
		<div class="photo"><img src="images/light.jpg" alt="Use natural light" /></div>
		<div class="details">Always use the sun to your advantage. To enhance the quality of your photos use as much natural light as possible. Always take photos with the sun behind you, lighting your subjects' face and avoid having any shadows across your subjects' face.</div>
      </div>
	   <div class="highlight">
	    <h1><strong>Capture the action</strong></h1>
	    <div class="photo"><img src="images/001.jpg" alt="Capture the action" /></div>
	    <div class="details">The best photos are often natural shots. If you are shooting someone painting, invite them to continue painting while you take their photo. Try and capture their expressions, while they are painting. Instead of having people posing for the camera on <span class="quotes">&ldquo;</span>Cheese<span class="quotes">&rdquo;</span>, invite them to talk to each other while you photograph.</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
	    <h1><strong>Change your point of view</strong></h1>
	    <div class="photo"><img src="images/002.jpg" alt="Change your point of view" /></div>
	    <div class="details">To add interest to your photo, take them from different angles. When taking a photo of a tree lay on the ground and take a photo from the base of the tree looking into its branches. Stand on a chair to take a photo of a group of friends sitting in a circle. Lay on the ground and take a photo of your friends in a circle above you.</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
	    <h1><strong>Capture as much colour as you can</strong></h1>
	    <div class="photo"><img src="images/003.jpg" alt="Capture as much colour as you can" /></div>
	    <div class="details">Fusion Books yearbooks are all in full-colour, so try and plan your photos to take in as much vibrant colours as possible. At the sports carnival, take photos of the athletes in action, but don&rsquo;t forget to take photos of the crowd cheering and their colourful banners.</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
	    <h1><strong>Avoid using digital zoom</strong></h1>
	    <div class="photo"><img src="images/004.jpg" alt="Avoid using digital zoom" /></div>
	    <div class="details">Unless you have a very high-quality camera avoid using the zoom. On cheaper digital cameras the zoom will make the image unclear. If you want to zoom, try and get closer to the subject and ensure the camera is in focus.</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
	    <h1><strong>Take lots of pictures</strong></h1>
	    <div class="photo"><img src="images/005.jpg" alt="Take lots of pictures" /></div>
	    <div class="details">With a digital camera you don't have to worry about film- so take lots of pictures, you may like to get back to the computer to decide.</div>
      </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
	    <h1><strong>Take photos for backgrounds</strong></h1>
	    <div class="photo"><img src="images/006.jpg" alt="Take photos for backgrounds" /></div>
	    <div class="details">With Fusion Books you can upload a photo to be used as a background on your page. Try and take a photo with lots of <span  class="quotes">&lsquo;</span>copy-space<span  class="quotes">&rsquo;</span>- a photo that allows lots of room for text in the middle and only has <span  class="quotes">&lsquo;</span>content<span  class="quotes">&rsquo;</span> around the edge of the photo. For example, on a sunny day take a photo of the sports oval with the blue sky taking up 4/5ths of the page. This will allow you to write text over the blue sky.</div>
