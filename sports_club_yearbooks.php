      <h1>Sports Club <span>Yearbooks</span></h1>
      <p>A yearbook is a great way to commemorate a successful season. They often highlight special moments on and off the field, successes and great sportsmanship.</p>
      <p>Your Sports Yearbook can include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>A Message from your club&rsquo;s President</li>
        <li>A <a href="sample_profile_questions.php">profile</a> of each of the players in your team</li>
        <li>List of Awards and Accolades granted throughout the season</li>
        <li>Photos from your Wind-Up or any other special events</li>
        <li>Snaps of the team, captain, coaches and parents at training and at games</li>
        <li>Team photo</li>
        <li>Photos of the team ground/court/field</li>
      </ul>
	  <div align="center"><img src="images/athletics.jpg" alt="Capture the action" title="Capture the action" /> <img src="images/sports.jpg" alt="A great way to remember your season" title="A great way to remember your season" /> <img src="images/footy.jpg" alt="Great memories, Great books!" title="Great memories, Great books!" /></div>
      <p>With Sports Yearbooks each player can have their own <a href="sample_profile_questions.php">profile</a> - where they can answer questions such as:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Name </li>
        <li>Team Position</li>
        <li>Email</li>
        <li>A highlight this season was&hellip;</li>
        <li>My favourite game this season was&hellip;</li>
        <li>I was proud to be part of my team when&hellip;</li>
      </ul>
