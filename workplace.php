A workplace yearbook can help to improve communication and an understanding of the company&rsquo;s strategic goals and direction. Workplace yearbooks have been created for all types of companies from small local businesses to multinational corporations. </p>
      <p>Corporate yearbooks often include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li> A Message from the Director&rsquo;s or CEO </li>
        <li>A profile of each staff member, including a photo and answers to questions on topics such as future aspirations, favourite work events and current goals.</li>
        <li>Photos from around the workplace</li>
        <li>Photos from special events throughout the year</li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="images/computergirl.jpg" alt="Access your yearbook anywhere, anytime" title="Access your yearbook anywhere, anytime" hspace="5" align="right" />Fusion Books can help make the design and printing process run smoothly and easily.
