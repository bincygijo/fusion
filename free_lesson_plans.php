      <h1>Free <span>Lesson Plans</span></h1>
      <p><img src="images/primary.jpg" alt="Free Lesson Plans" align="right" hspace="5" />Creating a yearbook is a great classroom task for a variety of subject areas. This section will show you how to use Fusion Books in different subject areas to create a fantastic yearbook with ease. Fusion Books removes the tedious aspects of creating Year Books creating small manageable tasks which are perfect for the classroom.</p>
      <p>The different tasks involved in creating a Fusion Yearbook can be broken down to suit one or many classes and subject areas throughout the school. The case study below of Mr Ludlow&rsquo;s Digital Media and design class demonstrates how Fusion Books can be integrated into learning and assessment tasks. The following tasks can also be incorporated into Business, Graphic Design, Art and English subject areas.</p>
      <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> Barrow High are creating a Graduation Book for their year 12 students, no one student or teacher wants to be lumped with all of the work. Mr Ludlow&rsquo;s has volunteered his Digital Media Class to take on the Graduation Book as an assessable class project.</p>
      <p>The students are broken up into small groups each focusing on a different part of the Book for example:</p>
	  <div class="highlight">
      <h1>Group 1- Profiles</h1>
      <p>This group would be responsible for setting up and maintaining the profile section of the Book, they would write the profile questions, and make sure all the students in the year have contributed. They would also be in charge of choosing the backgrounds and layout of the profile section.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
      <h1>Group 2- School Ball (other groups can be set up for other events)</h1>
      <p>Different groups can be allocated to different aspects of the book. For example one group may be in charge of the School Ball. This group would collect and upload photo&rsquo;s into the system and create photo and article pages relating to the school ball.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
      <h1>Group 3 - Cover and back cover design and layout of pages</h1>
      <p>This group may be chosen for their particular artistic flair and design skills. They will be in charge of designing the cover and back cover of the yearbook as well as the layout and order of other pages in the book.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
      <h1>Group 4 - Editors and Sponsorship</h1>
      <p>This group has a particularly important role in the yearbook as they determine the final content of the book. This group reviews every page for style, errors and appropriateness and has the ability to make and recommend changes. If your school is seeking sponsorship for you yearbook, this group can also call local businesses and parents to sell advertising space or ask for donations.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
      <h1>Individual Task/ Assessment</h1>
      <p>As well as the group task&rsquo;s Mr Ludlow has also introduced an individual design task which will be assessed. Each student is to design a photo or article page from scratch using a program like photoshop , publisher or indesign. Students can then upload their pages into the system as full page images</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="highlight">
      <h1>English Class invited to contribute</h1>
      <p>English classes are great for creating Article Pages in your year/graduation book. English students can be directed by their teachers to write an article on a school event or related subject. Students can use this article to create a page in the yearbook by selecting a layout, background and uploading photo&rsquo;s all in the Fusion Books System.</p>
