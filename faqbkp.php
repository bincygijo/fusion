      <p><b><a name="Q1" id="Q1"></a>I have been hearing a lot about Fusion Books, how does Fusion Books save time?</b></p>
      <p>Every aspect of Fusion Books has been designed to be quick and fun, while ensuring only the highest quality product.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Reordering pages in your book? Simply drag and drop.</li>
        <li>Need people to contribute? Add their email address or print an invitation.</li>
        <li>Need a proof copy? Click <span class="quotes">&lsquo;</span>Preview Book<span class="quotes">&rsquo;</span> and have a high-quality PDF proof.</li>
        <li>Formatting? Choose from an array of artist designed layouts.</li>
        <li>Contents page? Auto-created!<br />
        ...Fusion Books has been designed to save you time.</li>
      </ul>
	  <div class="dotline"></div>
      <p><b><a name="Q2" id="Q2"></a>What kind of paper stock do you use?</b></p>
      <p>All our books are printed on high-quality 150 gram paper. Our soft covers are printed on premium 300 GSM gloss-laminate stock. Large orders are printed using offset printing, while smaller orders are printed using digital printing technology.</p>
	  <div class="dotline"></div>
      <p><b><a name="Q3" id="Q3"></a>Are there any computer requirements? Do I have to download any software?</b></p>
      <p>Fusion Books does not require you to download any software. So you can access your book anywhere you can access the Internet. Fusion Books works on both Windows and Macs.</p>
	  <div class="dotline"></div>
      <p><b><a name="Q4" id="Q4"></a>Our media class usually creates our yearbook. Are they still able to contribute?</b></p>
      <p>We believe Fusion Books makes creating a yearbook or a Graduation book a more manageable task for students. Instead of creating the entire yearbook from scratch, the students can create several pages in PhotoShop or any other design program and upload them as a full-page in the book. These would create interesting feature pages, for example; a collage.</p>
	  <div class="dotline"></div>
      <p><b><a name="Q5" id="Q5"></a>How much does a Fusion Book cost?</b></p>
      <p>We guarantee our prices are competitive. All our prices include full-access to the Fusion Books system throughout the year, printing and delivery. Prices depend on the number of pages in your book and the number of copies ordered. We offer a variety of options to suit your budget. Contact us to obtain a quote.</p>

      <p><b><a name="Q6" id="Q6"></a>What is the best Internet Broswer to use?</b></p>

	  <div class="dotline"></div>
      <p><b><a name="Q14" id="Q14"></a>What is the difference between a yearbook and a Graduation Book?</b></p>
      <p>In a school environment yearbooks are typically used to commemorate a year of the entire school, while Graduation Books are created to reflect upon the years at school of the graduating class.</p>
	  <div class="dotline"></div>
      <p><b><a name="Q15" id="Q15"></a>Do we have to pay to use the software?</b></p>
